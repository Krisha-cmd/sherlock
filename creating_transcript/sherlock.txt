 Sorry? Which was it? Afghanistan or Iraq? Afghanistan, sorry. How did you...? Ah, Molly, coffee, thank you. What happened to the lipstick? It wasn't working for me. Really? I thought it was a big improvement. That's too small, ma'am. Okay. How do you feel about the violin? Sorry, what? I play the violin when I'm thinking sometimes I don't talk to days on. And with that body, potential flatmates should never worse about each other. You told him about me. Not at all. Then who said anything about flatmates? I did. Todd Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for. Now here it is. Just after lunch with an old friend, clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn't that a difficult lead? How did you know about Afghanistan? I had a nice little place in central London. Together we ought to be able to afford it. We'll meet there tomorrow evening seven o'clock. Sorry, got it dashed together by riding crop in the mortuary. Is that it? Is that what? When he just met, we're going to go look at a flat. Robbie? We don't know a thing about each other. I don't know where we're meeting. I don't even know your name. I know you're an army doctor and you've been a belligerent home from Afghanistan. And they've got a brother who's worried about you but you won't go to him for help because you don't approve of him. Possibly because he's an alcoholic. More likely because he recently walked out on his wife. And I know that your therapist thinks you're limp, psychosomatic, quite correctly, I'm afraid. It's enough to be going on with this, don't you think? The name Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street. Afternoon. You don't want to know that. You don't want to know that. Hello? Hello? Hi. What's the hunt? Sherlock's leave. Oh, isn't that Brian Scott? That's being expensive. And Mrs. Hudson, the 9 lady, has been a special deal. Open her favour. Three years back her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help her. Three years? You stopped her husband being executed. Oh no, I'm sure of it. Sherlock. Mrs. Hudson, Dr. John Watson. Thank you. Thank you. Joey? Yeah. Well, this could be very nice. Very nice indeed. Yes. Yes, I think so. My thoughts precisely. So I'll straighten out the move there. I've just cleaned out. Oh. So this is... Well, I was there. I can straighten things up. A bit? Just go. Friend or mine? Well, I say friend. What do you think, then, Dr. Watson? There's another bedroom upstairs if you've been needing two bedrooms. Of course we'll be needing two. Oh, don't worry. There's all sorts around here. Mrs. Turner next door has got married once. Oh. Sherlock, the mess you've made. I looked you up on the internet last night. Anything interesting? Found your website, the Science of Deduction. What did you think? You said you could identify a software designer by his tie and an airline pilot by his left thumb? Yes. And I could read your military career and your face and your leg and your brother's drinking habits and your mobile phone. How? What about these two insights, then, Sherlock? Thought that'd be right up your street. Three exactly the same. Four. There's been a fourth. There's something different this time. A fourth? Well, Brixton, Larson Gardens. What's new about this one? You wouldn't have come to get me if there wasn't something different. You know, they never leave notes. Yeah. This one did. Will you come? Who's on forensics? Anderson. Anderson won't work with me. Well, you won't be your assistant. I need an assistant. Will you come? Not a police car. I'll be right behind. Thank you. Brilliant! Yes! Ah! For our stereo suicides and now and now. Ah, it's Christmas. Mrs. Hudson, I'll be late. Might need some food. I'm your land lady, dear. Not your house key. Something cold will do. John, have a cup of tea. Make yourself at home. Don't wait up. Look at him, lashing about. My husband was just the same. But you're more the sitting down, Ty Buck and Tell. I'm at either cup or you rest your leg. Down my leg! Sorry. I am so sorry. It's just sometimes this bloody thing. I understand, dear. I've got a hip. The cup of tea will be lovely. Thank you. Does this one scare and not your housekeeper? A couple of this kids too if you've got it. Not your housekeeper. You're an doctor. Actually, you're an army doctor. Yes. Any good? Very good. You've seen a lot of injuries then. Violent deaths. Yes. Did you travel to either? Of course. Yes. Enough. For a lifetime. For too much. Want to see some more? No. God, yes. Sorry, Mrs. Hanson. I'll skip the tea. Pop out. Close up, you. The possible suicides. Four of them. There's no point sitting at home unless finally something fun going on. Right. You all have to be at least. Not decent. The game, Mrs. Hanson, is on. Go, James. Okay. Okay, you've got questions. Yeah, where are we going? I'm seeing. Next. Who are you? What do you do? What do you think? I'm saying private detective. But? The police don't go to private detectives. I'm a consulting detective. The only one in the world that invented the job. What does that mean? It means when the police are out of their depth, which is always they consult me. The police don't consult amateurs. What I met you for the first time yesterday, I said Afghanistan or Iraq, you look surprised. Yes, I did, you know. I didn't know. I saw. You have got the way you hold yourself, says the minute three. Your conversation is you ended the year in mid-April from my day. Said, trained at bar, so army doctor, obvious. Your face is tan. You're no tan above the wrist. You've been abroad but not sun-loving. Your lips are really bad when you walk in the dark. I asked for a chair when you stand like you forgot about it. So it's at least partly psychosomatic. That's the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic. You didn't action then. We didn't action. So I'm tan, Afghanistan or Iraq. You said I had a therapist. You're a psychosomatic limper. Of course you've got a therapist. Then there's your brother. His phone is expensive. You may enable them to be three-player. Or you look at your brother, a flash, you wouldn't waste money on this. It's a gift. Scratch is not one. Many other times. It's been the same pocket as keys and coins. Mattering next to you wouldn't treat this one like this. It's had a previous owner and next bit to you. You know it already. The engraving. Harry Watson, clearly family member who's given you his old phone. Not your father. This is a young man's gadget. It could be a cousin. Or here we can't find a place to live. Unlike you've got an extended plan. And certainly not when you're close to a brother. It is now Clara.
